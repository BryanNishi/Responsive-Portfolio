        <p>Hi! I'm Bryan Nishi. I'm curerntly attending Denver University's Fullstack Bootcamp. I hope to be a front end web
            developer but with the knowledge I gain from the bootcamp I hope to work on projects having to do with automobiles,
            home improvement, or anything in the geek spectrum.</p>
        <p>I am currently working corporate audio visual in the hospitality industry. After many years of toying with the idea
            of working with computers, I've decided on a career change. I think my creative side and my love of computers
            combines nicley and is a great fit for coding. Time will tell of course, but I'm quite optimistic!</p>
        <p>I'm a big nerd at heart and have many interests. Other than automobiles and home improvement, I enjoy video games,
            computers, dungeons and dragons, anime, ballroom dancing, and theatre.</p>
        <p>Finally, here is some pirate themed ipsum for your enjoyment and to make me seem more interesting! Admiral of the
